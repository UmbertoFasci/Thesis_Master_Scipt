# INTRODUCTION
Emerging infectious diseases pose a great threat to global biodiversity and are responsible for species declines and extinctions around the globe (Fisher et al., 2012). Many amphibian population declines have been attributed to the chytrid fungus, /Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis/, the causative agent of Chytridiomycosis (Kerry et al., 2007; Berger et al., 1998; Voyles et al., 2009). Past studies have indicated that amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates by body size and that Chytridiomycosis has contributed to the decline of at least 501 amphibian species globally, with several that have been driven to complete extinction (Carvalho et al., 2017; Ripple et al., 2017; Fisher and Gerner, 2020). While many studies have employed conventional field and laboratory methods to delineate the pathogenicity of /B. dendrobatidis/, several have utilized spatial modeling techniques to determine the effect of variable factors on its distribution.
Species distribution modeling is a commonly used modeling technique that is based on the relationship between species occurrences and the environmental variables recorded at their locations (Komori et al., 2020). These models can be utilized for many applications within the field of ecology including identifying threats to the conservation of species (e.g. Thuiller et al., 2005), managing the impacts of species invasions (e.g. Walther et al., 2009), and for predicting the spread of zoonotic disease through host and vector species distribution model analysis (e.g. de Almeida et al., 2019). Species distribution modeling for fungi has been historically rare compared with other taxa (Elith and Leathwick, 2009) but has increased in application in the recent past (Hao et al., 2020). For /B. dendrobatidis/, environmental variables/factors such as altitude, temperature and precipitation related variables have been identified as contributors to its distribution (Stuart et al., 2004; Berger et al., 2004 and Raffel et al., 2015). It is postulated that temperature increases will lead to the range expansion of pathogen distributions, leading to more contact with potential hosts (Garrett et al., 2006). Climate conditions often influence disease outbreaks (Pascual et al., 2008) and are indicated to influence chytridiomycosis infections (Bosch et al., 2007).
Previous research has addressed the link between the changing climate and human-associated factors to the future distribution of /B. dendrobatidis/ (Rohr et al., 2011). However, none to date have addressed how these factors interact to shape these predictions. Therefore, my primary research question is: How much variation in the distribution of /B. dendrobatidis/ is unique to and shared among climate, human, and other factors given their individual contributions to determining the distribution? In other words, how do human and climatic factors interact statistically, and how do these interactions affect the predicted distribution of /B. dendrobatidis/?
I hypothesize that (H1) temperature will play an important role in determining the distribution of /B. dendrobatidis/, where a temperature range of habitat suitability can be determined, and future projections involving an increase in temperature will contribute to an increase in habitat suitability for /B. dendrobatidis/. (H2) human population density (HPD) and other anthropogenic variables will have a positive relationship with the habitat suitability of /B. dendrobatidis/ unique from its relationship with climate.
Based on my research question and hypotheses, my study objectives are: (1) determine environmental and anthropogenic variables important to /B. dendrobatidis/ occurrence, (2) construct baseline (current conditions), and future projection models of the potential habitat suitability for /B. dendrobatidis/, (3) delineate the percent contributions and permutation importance of each of the environmental and anthropogenic variables, (4) identify the statistical characteristics between the variation contributed.
