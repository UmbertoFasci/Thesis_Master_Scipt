# Annual Mean Temperature (2011-2040) ssp126
![image info](../../Analysis_Plots/Full_Extent_OnlyEnvs/Mean_Annual_Temp_1140_126.png)
### First Impressions

* The highest suitability level for *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* is found to occur towards the lower end of this environmental variable.

* Looking at the figure on the left, the mapped environmental data for Annual Mean Temperature between the 2011-2040 time frame under the ssp126 projection expresses mean temperatures at the lower end towards the South of the extent. This is further contained near the coast line of the South East extent of the data.

### What does this suggest?

* This suggests that the higher annual average temperatures of the areas away from the coast is not suitable for *B. dendrobatidis*. The cooler annual temperatures at the coast promote better suitability.

### What does the literature say?

* The relationship between *B. dendrobatidis* and temperature is an important one as it is also highly involved in the pathogen-host relationship. On one hand, amphibians invest more energy in immune system processes in warmer temperatures. On the other, *B. dendrobatidis'* abundance increases in cooler temperatures. The relationship between these two systems connected to temperature has not been fully explained.

* Furthermore, the recorded temperature range at which *B. dendrobatidis* expresses optimal growth is between (17-25) degrees celsius. Which also happens to reflect the suitability range of *B. dendrobatidis* when looking at the plot on the right.

### What do the level stats say?
According to the Kruskal-Wallis test, each suitability level is significantly different when plotted against Annual Mean Temperature in the 2011-2040 year range average at RCP 2.6 with $p < 2.2 \times 10^{-16}$.
