### First Impressions

* The highest suitability level for *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* is found to occur towards the lower end of this environmental variable.

* Looking at the figure on the left, the mapped environmental data for Annual Mean Temperature between the 2011-2040 time frame under the ssp126 projection.

### What does this suggest?

* This suggests that the higher annual average temperatures of the areas away from the coast is not suitable for *B. dendrobatidis*. The cooler annual temperatures at the coast promote better suitability.
